      "When George Clinton first heard hip-hop artists blending old records with new beats, he wasn’t too impressed. But then Dr. Dre turned samples of Clinton’s P-Funk sides into G-Funk, and Dr. Funkenstein approved, calling funk “the DNA of hip-hop and rap.” Dre had already taken gangsta rap to the mainstream with his earlier group, N.W.A, but on The Chronic, he funked up the rhymes with a smooth bass-heavy production style and the laid-back delivery of then-unknown rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. When Dre and Snoop dropped “Nuthin’ But a ‘G’ Thang,” there was no getting out of the way.",

    summary:
      "The Beatles' sixth studio album Rubber Soul is arguably the best album of all time, though some may argue it’s not even the best album The Beatles made. The album came after their exposure to Bob Dylan and pot. It was only their second album to contain completely original songs. The lyrical content on the album is markedly more sophisticated than their previous material. The name “Rubber Soul” is a pun on soul music and a shoe’s rubber sole. Paul once heard a critic describe the Rolling Stones as “good, but really ‘plastic soul’”, and decided to change up the expression to create the new title.",

    summary:
      "Michael Jackson towered over the 1980s the way Elvis Presley dominated the 1950s, and here’s why. On Thriller, the child R&B star ripened into a Technicolor soulman: a singer, dancer and songwriter with incomparable crossover instincts. He and producer Quincy Jones heighten the sheen (The Girl Is Mine), pump up the theater (Thriller) and deepen the funk. But, the most thrilling thing was the autobiography busting through the gloss: the hiss of denial on Billie Jean; the to-hell-with-haters strut of Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'. Jackson was at the peak of his art and adulthood.",
